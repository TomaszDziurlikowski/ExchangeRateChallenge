Installation
Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app.

The application requires an access key to function correctly. You will need to add your own access key to the application.properties file.

Open src/main/resources/application.properties and find the line:

access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE Replace YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE with your actual access key.

Build the Project

For Maven:

mvn clean install

For Maven:
mvn spring-boot:run
